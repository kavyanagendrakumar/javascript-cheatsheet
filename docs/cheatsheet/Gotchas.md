# ü§Ø 5 JavaScript Gotchas (Explained Simply)

---

## 1. **`this` Keyword Confusion**

In JavaScript, `this` depends on **how** a function is called, not *where* it is written.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'JS',
  say() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

const sayFunc = obj.say;
sayFunc(); // undefined üò±
```

**Why?**  
- `sayFunc` is **called standalone**, so `this` becomes `undefined` (in strict mode) or `window` (in sloppy mode).
- In Java/C#, `this` always refers to the class instance ‚Äî not so in JS!

‚úÖ **Fix**: Use arrow functions or bind explicitly.

---

## 2. **Hoisting**

JavaScript **moves declarations** (not initializations) to the top of their scope.

```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined, not error!
var a = 5;
```

**Why?**  
- `var a` is hoisted and initialized as `undefined` at the top.
- `let` and `const` are hoisted too, but stay in a *"temporal dead zone"* where accessing them throws an error.

‚úÖ **Tip**: Prefer `let` and `const` to avoid hoisting surprises.

---

## 3. **Loose Equality `==` vs Strict Equality `===`**

`==` does **type coercion** before comparing.

```javascript
0 == false;       // true üò±
'0' == 0;          // true üò±
null == undefined; // true
```

**Why?**  
- JavaScript tries to "helpfully" convert types.
- Leads to unpredictable behavior.

‚úÖ **Tip**: Always use `===` unless you have a *very* good reason.

---

## 4. **Array Holes (Sparse Arrays)**

Arrays can have "empty" slots ‚Äî and behave strangely.

```javascript
const arr = [1, , 3];
console.log(arr.length); // 3
console.log(arr[1]);     // undefined
console.log(arr.map(x => x * 2)); // [2, , 6] (the hole remains)
```

**Why?**  
- JavaScript treats missing elements differently from `undefined`.
- Some array methods skip empty slots.

‚úÖ **Tip**: Be careful when creating or manipulating sparse arrays.

---

## 5. **Floating Point Math Issues**

Because of how numbers are stored in memory (IEEE-754 floating-point standard), math isn't always exact.

```javascript
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3); // false üò±
console.log(0.1 + 0.2);         // 0.30000000000000004
```

**Why?**  
- Floating point rounding errors happen internally.

‚úÖ **Tip**: Use rounding when comparing decimals.

```javascript
function almostEqual(a, b) {
  return Math.abs(a - b) < Number.EPSILON;
}
```

## Function bind
this is set to the object when function is bound. Even if the object changes values later, the original value of object is bound to the function
```javascript
let user = {
firstName: "John",
sayHi() {
console.log(`Hello, ${this.firstName}!`);
}
};
let sayHi = user.sayHi.bind(user); // (*)
// can run it without an object
sayHi(); // Hello, John!
setTimeout(() => {
sayHi() // Hello, Joen!
}, 1000); // Hello, John!
// even if the value of user changes within 1 second
// sayHi uses the pre-bound value which is reference to the old user object
user = {
sayHi() { alert("Another user in setTimeout!"); }
};
sayHi(); // Hello, John!
console.log(user.firstName) // undefined
```

## Static methods
Static properties/methods are used when we‚Äôd like to store class-level data, also not bound to an instance. 
Static methods are inherited between classes.
Subclasses can call or override them.
They are not accessible on instances ‚Äî only on constructors.

Ex: why obj.toString() can't be static - 
It‚Äôs designed to be overridden per object.

It needs access to instance data via this.

JS allows custom representations by modifying the prototype, not the constructor.

Static methods are ideal for utility functions that don't require access to instance-specific data.

Prototype methods are designed for operations that need to interact with or modify the instance's data.

The placement of a method (static vs. prototype) is determined by whether it needs access to the instance (this) or can function independently.

Why Array.prototype.keys() can't be static - 
.keys() returns an iterator of the indices of the array it‚Äôs called on.

It must access the internal structure of the array ‚Äî its length, indices, holes, etc.

So it relies on this being the array ‚Äî which is why it's an instance (prototype) method.

If same method name exists in prototype chain and constructor chain - They don't conflict because 
Animal.speak() calls the static method.

a.speak() (where a is an instance) calls the instance method on the prototype chain.

They don‚Äôt conflict because:

Static methods are on the constructor (Animal)

Prototype methods are on Animal.prototype ‚Äî used by instances

As we know, the ‚Äúextends‚Äù syntax sets up two prototypes:
1. Between "prototype" of the constructor functions (for methods).
2. Between the constructor functions themselves (for static methods).
   ```javascript
   class Rabbit extends Object {}
   
    alert( Rabbit.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype ); // (1) true
    alert( Rabbit.__proto__ === Object ); // (2) true

   // So Rabbit now provides access to the static methods of Object via Rabbit , like this:
    class Rabbit extends Object {}
    // normally we call Object.getOwnPropertyNames
    alert ( Rabbit.getOwnPropertyNames({a: 1, b: 2})); // a,b
    
    // But if we don‚Äôt have extends Object , then Rabbit.__proto__ is not set to Object .
    // for the built-in Object constructor, 
    Object.__proto__ === Function.prototype .
   ```
## var
1. Variables, declared with var, are either function-scoped or global-scoped. They are visible through blocks.
2. The same thing for loops: var cannot be block- or loop-local like in for loop. If declared with var, it's visible after for loop
3. If a code block is inside a function, then var becomes a function-level variable
4. ‚Äúvar‚Äù tolerates redeclarations. If we declare the same variable with let twice in the same scope, that‚Äôs an error
5. ‚Äúvar‚Äù variables can be declared below their use because they are hoisted. Declarations are hoisted, but assignments are not

## Global Object (Window in browser, for Node.js it is global)
7. In-browser, unless we‚Äôre using modules, global functions and variables declared with var become a property of the global object.
8. If a value is so important that you‚Äôd like to make it available globally, write it directly as a property. That said, using global variables is generally discouraged.
```javascript
  window.currentUser = {
    name: "John"
  };
```
8. We use the global object to test for support of modern language features. For instance, test if a built-in Promise object exists (it doesn‚Äôt in really old browsers). If there‚Äôs none (say, we‚Äôre in an old browser), we can create ‚Äúpolyfills‚Äù: add functions that are not supported by the environment, but exist in the modern standard.
```javascript
  if (!window.Promise) {
    window.Promise = ... // custom implementation of the modern language feature
  }
```

## Error scenarios
1.
```javascript
// show message
let message = "Hello";
alert(message);
// show another message
let message = "Goodbye"; // Error: variable already declared
alert(message);
```
2. If a variable you are trying to access is not found anywhere, that‚Äôs an error in strict mode (without use strict, an assignment to a non-existing variable creates a new global variable, for compatibility with old code)
